[StatLab](https://library.virginia.edu/data/statlab), part of the [University of Virginia Library](https://www.library.virginia.edu/), is a consulting group that supports researchers in the areas of statistics and data science. Members of the UVA community can contact us at statlab@virginia.edu to set up a free consultation.

We help with a range of challenges, including:

- Data wrangling and cleaning
- Sample size and power estimation
- Selecting, implementing, and intepreting statistical methods
- Model evaluation
- Data visualization
- Debugging statistical software

We also offer [free workshops](https://library.virginia.edu/data/training) and write [articles about statistics and data science](https://library.virginia.edu/data/articles).

In collaboration with graduate student fellows, we produce statistical-programming resources and host them here on GitHub:

- [_Statistical Modeling Examples in R_](https://uvastatlab.github.io/sme/): Worked examples of statistical modeling in R, including linear regression, logistic regression, count modeling, and multilevel modeling. Published using [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-13.html) and occasionally updated.
- [_Python and R_](https://uvastatlab.github.io/Python_and_R/): A book providing parallel code examples in Python and R to help analysts and researchers translate between and learn the languages. Published in 2021 using [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) and no longer updated. (Mostly obsolete thanks to AI)

We also use GitHub to host resources to help us with consultations and [StatLab articles](https://library.virginia.edu/data/articles):

- [Consulting resources](https://github.com/uvastatlab/consulting_resources): A list of selected bookmarks to sites we frequently reference
- [R to Stata Cheatsheet](https://uvastatlab.github.io/R_to_Stata/): Common statistical tasks in R translated to Stata. (Mostly obsolete thanks to AI)
- [Accessibility Checklist](https://github.com/uvastatlab/accessibility_checklist): Reference to help us develop more accessible materials
- [GitHub Guide](https://github.com/uvastatlab/git_guide): StatLab guide to Git branching, merging, and stashing
- [R install and update](https://clayford.github.io/r_install/): Installing and Updating R, RStudio and R Packages
