[StatLab](https://library.virginia.edu/data/statlab), part of the [University of Virginia Library](https://www.library.virginia.edu/), is a consulting group that supports researchers in the areas of statistics and data science. Members of the UVA community can contact us at statlab@virginia.edu to set up a free consultation.

We help with a range of challenges, including:

- Data wrangling and cleaning
- Sample size and power estimation
- Selecting, implementing, and intepreting statistical methods
- Model evaluation
- Data visualization
- Debugging statistical software

We also offer [free workshops](https://library.virginia.edu/data/training) and write [articles about statistics and data science](https://library.virginia.edu/data/articles).

In collaboration with graduate student fellows, we produce statistical-programming resources and host them here on GitHub:
- [_Python and R_](https://uvastatlab.github.io/Python_and_R/): A book providing parallel code examples in Python and R to help analysts and researchers translate between and learn the languages
- [_Statistical Modeling Examples in R_](https://uvastatlab.github.io/sme/): Worked examples of statistical modeling in R, including linear regression, logistic regression, count modeling, and multilevel modeling
